        "# Data Augmentation by Paraphrasing\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook showcases an ongoing research feature that we have been working on to add to Rasa Open Source.\n",
        "\n",
        "As developers start building their assistant, one of the major tasks is to add training data for all intents they plan to cover. In order to ensure their assistant is able to handle real world conversations, they need to anticipate different variations in which their users can express the same intent. The more training data we add, the more robust our NLU models become to incoming user messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "We think it will be helpful to have an interactive data augmentation tool which helps the developer in coming up with these variations and augments the training data with them to increase the robustness of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "So we built a paraphrasing model, which takes as input a sentence and generates multiple paraphrased versions of the same sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example: \n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "input message: I want to book an appointment for tomorrow.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generated Paraphrases\n",
        "---------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "- I want to book an appointment for tomorrow.\n",
        "- i need to book an appointment for another meeting.\n",
        "- i want to make an appointment for tomorrow.\n",
        "- i want to book a spot tomorrow.\n",
        "- i want to book a reservation for tomorrow.\n",
        "- we need to book an appointment for tomorrow.\n",
        "- i want to book an appointment for tomorrow at 11 : 00.\n",
        "- i 'd like to meet tomorrow.\n",
        "- i 'd like you to arrange a session for tomorrow.\n",
        "- i 'll book a reservation for tomorrow.\n",
        "- i 'd like to book the appointment for tomorrow.\n",
        "- i 'd like to make an appointment for tomorrow.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "As you can see, since some of them are grammatically and semantically meaningful, we can build an interactive tool in Rasa OSS or Rasa X where developers can pick and choose variations they like and then add them to their existing training data."
