Today in the country there are only five medical centers in the largest cities - in Kaunas, Klaipeda, Siauliai, Panevezys and Vilnius. In the districts, something like paramedic points remained for emergency assistance.\\nIf there are few hospitals, then there are few doctors - and today this problem is one of the main ones, we have to involve senior students of medical universities in the fight against the epidemic, but all the same, specialists are sorely lacking.\\nThe Minister of Defense of Lithuania Raimundas Karoblis has already promised that the military will be sent to help the doctors, but would anyone really want him to be treated not by a doctor, but, for example, by an artilleryman?\\nThe second problem associated with the consequences of “democratic reforms” is that the country does not have strategic food supplies. Although just a few days ago, on March 19, the Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernialis assured the country\\'s population that there were enough products in the “bins of the motherland” and there was no cause for concern. But everything was spoiled by the ex-Minister of Agriculture Kazis Starkevičius, who told reporters that there is cause for concern and that it lies in the fact that Lithuania does not have a strategic supply of food.\\n“In 2010, in case of emergency, 200 thousand cans of canned pork, 3.5 thousand tons of wheat flour, 1.6 thousand tons of rice, 1.3 thousand tons of semolina, 700 tons of sugar were bought for state reserve warehouses. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, today the food reserve consists only of grain and sugar. The remaining reserves are eaten, \"\\n- said Kazis Starkevičius.\\nAccording to him, in 2012 amendments to the law on the state reserve were adopted, according to which \"reserves were accumulated on the basis of preliminary agreements.\" This meant that companies, receiving money in advance, pledged in an extreme situation to supply everything necessary for the needs of the population. However, today no one really knows which companies are suppliers, moreover, in the context of the global crisis, whether these suppliers can provide the country with everything necessary is unknown.\\nStarkevičius recalled that in January of this year alone, more than 9 thousand tons of chicken meat was produced in Lithuania, 40% of which was exported, and the rest was eaten. And nothing fell into the state reserve.\\nThe ex-head of the Ministry of Agriculture insists that it is urgent to provide assistance to farmers, who today not only have nothing to buy fertilizers and spare parts for machinery, but it’s generally impossible to buy planting stock due to quarantine restrictions. This year\\'s harvest is already at stake, Starkevičius warned.\\nAgainst this background, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, speaking on Monday, March 23, said that there is a possibility of imposing martial law in the country.

            "173    Social network users found on the Internet a study of bat coronavirus, in which scientists were able to modify the strain so that it infects humans. Scientists from the USA were engaged in the work back in 2015, and people saw this as confirmation of one of their favorite conspiracy theories related to COVID-2019.\\nThe COVID-2019 epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, managed to get out of China and spread throughout the world in two months. In mid-March, an article became popular in social networks according to which a dangerous strain was artificially created as part of a study of bat coronavirus by American scientists.\\nThe scientific work was written by a team of biologists back in 2015, on November 9 of the same year it was published on the scientific portal Nature. Researchers studied the SHCo14 virus found in Chinese horseshoe bats.\\nScientists combined this strain with another - its name is SARS, and it causes a severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Further, the researchers “generated and characterized a chimeric virus that can <...> multiply in the primary cells of the human respiratory tract.\" In other words, biologists altered the coronavirus of bats so much that they got a strain that could infect a person - and the virus would cause severe pneumonia in him. When it all ends, I will write an autobiographical masterpiece, \"How I Survived Without Leaving Home.\" What will you do?\\nAmong the authors of the article are listed as researchers at the University of North Carolina, USA, and the Wuhan Virology Institute, China. In 2020, users of social networks read the old scientific material and they had suspicions about who is behind the COVID-2019 epidemic.\\nIf some people, having read the article, decided to share with subscribers the very fact of its existence, then others are already building theories. They are sure: the coronavirus epidemic is the work of the US government, and one of the goals of this diversion was to strike at its own citizens.\\nOn Russian-language Twitter, they also looked at the results of a study by scientists.\\nWilly Wilmer, a German lawyer and politician, really believes that the coronavirus was brought to China by infected American soldiers who arrived in the country for sporting events. People agree with his version, and are ready to blame the United States for thousands of deaths.\\nSome users are sure that there are only two countries that will repulse the United States in the situation with coronavirus, although they do not yet say how they will do it.\\nAnd someone was not at all surprised that the United States was considered the culprit of the pandemic.\\nThe comments did not answer the question, however, a military event was indeed held in China. The World War Games were held in Wuhan at the end of October 2019, probably Willy Wimmer referred to them. At least Igor Nikulin, a former member of the UN Commission on Biological and Chemical Weapons, interpreted the German politician’s assumption exactly and completely agree with him.\\nBoth politicians came to such conclusions not without reason. These thoughts were prompted by the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China Zhao Lijian, who also believes that COVID-2019 was brought into his country by the US military. Users who commented on a post about Willy Wimmer’s words and laboratory research in North Carolina 2015, are sure that Americans are really to blame for everything - and only because of their attitude to the rest of the world.\\nBut it was not difficult for other users to guess which television channel most commentators prefer to watch.\\nAnd another commentator suggested that the reason for such hatred of people towards the USA is the refusal of medicines.\\nAnother commentator, learning about the experiments in the laboratory of North Carolina, easily believed in the guilt of the States and even suggested what to do with this country.\\nThe news that the coronavirus reached the United States, this person is very happy.\\nBut there is an assumption that the United States came up with a coronavirus not only for China, but also for other countries. For each nationality - its own separate strain.\\nIn fact, while the virus, supposedly created in 2015, is being discussed only by politicians and scientists far from laboratories. Until now, specialists in the region have not published the results of comparisons of strains.\\nEven before people learned about research in the North Carolina laboratory, they were building theories about where the coronavirus came from, and there was nothing to do with natural causes. In their research, the main suspects were God, Putin and the Marxist revolutionaries.\\nThere are other considerations in this regard. Before the coronavirus spread around the world and caused a pandemic, users of social networks began to speculate about who was behind it. Bill Gates and his wife came under fire from conspiracy theorists.\n",
