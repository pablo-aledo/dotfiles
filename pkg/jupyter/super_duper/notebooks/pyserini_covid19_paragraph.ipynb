After incubation of the nsp1 protein with RRL at 4Â°C for 30 min, we added different concentrations of capped and polyadenylated Renilla luciferase mRNA transcripts (rLuc RNA) to the mixture, and incubated the samples in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine for 30 min. In control samples in which rLuc RNA was incubated with GST and nsp1-mt proteins, rLuc activity and labeled rLuc protein levels increased with rising mRNA concentrations. In contrast, the rLuc activity and labeled rLuc protein levels in the nsp1-containing sample was substantially lower than in the control samples; the rLuc activity and the radiolabeled rLuc protein levels in the presence of nsp1 were about 6-8% of the levels observed with GST or nsp1-mt ( Fig.  1a and b) , which clearly demonstrated that nsp1 efficiently inhibited the rLuc protein synthesis from capped rLuc RNA in RRL.']"

              " \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), the causative agent of a newly emerged disease, SARS, is an enveloped virus that contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of about 29.7 kb.1 Upon infection, the genome expression begins with the translation of gene 1, which constitutes the 5'-end two-thirds of the viral genome, to produce two large precursor polyproteins2,3 that are proteolytically processed by 2 virally encoded proteinases to generate 16 mature proteins, namely nsp1 to nsp162. While Users may view, print, copy, download and text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html#terms most of these gene 1 proteins are essential for viral RNA synthesis, some of them appear to have other biological functions. [4] [5] [6] [7] The most N-terminal gene 1 protein, nsp1, has unique biological functions; expressed SCoV nsp1 induces host mRNA degradation and suppresses host translation8. The expressed nsp1 suppresses the host antiviral signaling pathways as well9. Furthermore, nsp1 suppresses host gene expression, including type I interferon (IFN) production, by promoting host mRNA degradation and host translation suppression in infected cells10. The nsp1 of a closely related mouse hepatitis virus also suppresses host gene expression and is a viral virulence factor11. These data suggest that the SCoV nsp1-mediated suppression of host genes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS. Accordingly, a delineation of the mechanisms of the nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression is considerably important for gaining insight into SCoV pathogenesis at the molecular level. We designed the present study to uncover the mechanism of nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression primarily by using an in vitro system. Our data revealed that nsp1 utilizes a novel, two-pronged strategy to inhibit host translation/gene expression.\"]"
