To put it simply correlation implies that two feature follow similar trends, i.e. as CGPA increases, GPA increases. In all fairness, GPA was calculated using CGPA, so they should be correlated.  However, two features from the dataset whose correlation may not be so obvious is the applicant's GRE score and their GPA. In the plot below the features still show similar trends, but they're less correlated than the previous two features."

        "\n",
        "We can describe one or more variables as a mathematical equation of one or more desired variables in the dataset. This allows individuals to be able to *predict* the value of variable, or response variable, using the present values of a model consisting of its terms. In terms of a linear regression, the model is to use a direct one-to-one mapping of terms to a response variable, thus the relationship being described is a *linear* one. \n",

        "Here I will define some terminology. It is common to find multiple definitions for terminology in any capacity, but especially in data science. This stems from the interdiscplinary aspect of the field where different fields have their respective definitions. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, so long as discussion leaves all parties with a cohesive understanding.\n",

        "\n",
        "***Algorithm*** - Although various definitions of algorithms exist, for the purpose of these tutorials we will subscribe to algoritms meaning a set of mathematical steps, or equations, to perform a task. Working under this definition implies that a model is a composition of algorithms. This definition is a personal preference, and used to estabilsh terminology confluence within the context of this tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "***Predictive Analysis*** - the creation and use of a model to derive meaning or speculation as to the state or behavior of a an object or system under certain constraints.\n",

        "***Exploratory Analysis*** - the process of determining underlining patterns and attributes of a data using statistical, heuristics, or other means not necessarily using a model.\n",

        "## Intro to the Math behind Linear Regressions\n",
        "Remember the formula in eq(1)? That was the algebraic equation for the response variable, where y is the response variable we want to model, a is the parameter we want to find to best map our term(s) x to the response, and b is noise that is inherent to the data. For the sake of simplicity, we can think of a response variable in relation to a single term so that we can better understand the intuition using algebra, but it is important to note that the aforementioned variables are vectors and matrices when dealing with multiple linear regressions which requires matrix algebra.  \n",
