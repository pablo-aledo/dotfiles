        "[RNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrent_neural_network), [LSTMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) and [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) are all the rage, and a recent [blog post](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) by Andrej Karpathy is doing a great job explaining what these models are and how to train them.\n",
        "It also provides some very impressive results of what they are capable of.  This is a great post, and if you are interested in natural language, machine learning or neural networks you should definitely read it. \n",

        "However, it feels to me that most readers of the post are impressed by the wrong reasons.\n",

        "\n",
        "In what follows I will briefly describe these character-level maximum-likelihood langauge models, which are much less magical than RNNs and LSTMs, and show that they too can produce a rather convincing Shakespearean prose. I will also show about 30 lines of python code that take care of both training the model and generating the output. Compared to this baseline, the RNNs may seem somehwat less impressive. So why was I impressed? I will explain this too, below."

        "The name is quite long, but the idea is very simple.  We want a model whose job is to guess the next character based on the previous *n* characters. For example, having seen `ello`, the next characer is likely to be either a commma or space (if we assume is is the end of the word \"hello\"), or the letter `w` if we believe we are in the middle of the word \"mellow\" or \"yellow\". Humans are quite good at this, but of course seeing a larger history makes things easier (if we were to see 5 letters instead of 4, the choice between space and `w` would have been much easier).\n",

        "\n",
        "So, we are seeing *n* letters, and need to guess the *n+1*th one. We are also given a large-ish amount of text (say, all of Shakespeare's works) that we can use. How would we go about solving this task?\n",
        "\n",
        "Mathematically, we would like to learn a function *P(c* | *h)*. Here, *c* is a character, *h* is a *n*-character history, and *P(c* | *h)* stands for how likely is it to see *c* after we've seen *h*.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps the simplest approach would be to just count and divide (a.k.a **maximum likelihood estimates**). We will count the number of times each letter *c* appeared after *h*, and divide by the total numbers of letters appearing after *h*. The **unsmoothed** part means that if we did not see a given letter following *h*, we will just give it a probability of zero.\n",
