# OWLv2

This folder contains a demo notebook to showcase the zero- and one-shot capabilities of Google's OWLv2, a scaled up version of OWL-ViT for object detection.

Note: the notebook was inspired by [this great notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/zeroshot_object_detection_with_owlvit.ipynb) which was created for v1. Credits go to Alara for this one.
