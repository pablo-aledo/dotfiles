# YOLOS notebooks
In this directory, you can find several notebooks that illustrate how to use [YOLOS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00666) both for fine-tuning on custom data as well as inference. It currently includes the following notebooks:

- [performing inference with YOLOS on a new image](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/YOLOS/YOLOS_minimal_inference_example.ipynb)
- [fine-tuning YOLOS on a custom dataset (balloon)](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/blob/master/YOLOS/Fine_tuning_YOLOS_for_object_detection_on_custom_dataset_(balloon).ipynb)

All models can be found on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models?search=yolos).
