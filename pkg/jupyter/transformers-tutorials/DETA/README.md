# DETA notebooks

DETA is a new model that improves upon Deformable DETR. Equipped with a Swin-large backbone and pre-trained on Object 365, it obtains an average precision (AP) of 63 on COCO.

`DetaForObjectDetection` has the same API as models like DETR, Deformable DETR and Conditional DETR, hence they can be fine-tuned in the same way.

This folder contains notebooks both for inference and fine-tuning on a custom dataset.
