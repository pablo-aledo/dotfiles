# AinD: Android (Anbox) in Docker

AinD launches Android apps in Docker, by nesting [Anbox](https://anbox.io/) containers inside Docker.

Unlike VM-based similar projects, AinD can be executed on IaaS instances without support for nested virtualization.

Docker Hub: [`aind/aind`](https://hub.docker.com/r/aind/aind)

## Purposes
* Anti-theft (see [FAQ](#faq))
* Android compatibility (via cloud) for iOS and Windows tablets

### Non-goals
* Cloud gaming

## Quick start
Tested on Ubuntu 19.10 (Kernel 5.3).
May not work on other distros.
If `modprobe ashmem_linux` or `modprobe binder_linux` fails, see https://github.com/anbox/anbox-modules .

```bash
sudo modprobe ashmem_linux
sudo modprobe binder_linux
```

```bash
docker run -td --name aind --privileged -p 5900:5900 -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro aind/aind
```

> NOTE: `--privileged` is required for nesting an Anbox (LXC) inside Docker. But you don't need to worry too much because Anbox launches "unprivileged" LXC using user namespaces. You can confirm that all Android processes are running as non-root users, by executing `docker exec aind ps -ef`.

Wait for 10-20 seconds until Android processes are shown up in `docker exec aind ps -ef`, and then connect to `5900` via `vncviewer`.

If the application manager doesn't shown up on the VNC screen, try `docker run ...` several times (FIXME).  Also make sure to check `docker logs aind`.

Future version will support connection from Web browsers (of phones and tablets) without VNC.

### Pre-installed Apps
* Firefox
* F-Droid
* Misc accessories like Clock and Calculator

### Installing apk packages

APK files mounted as `/apk.d/*.apk` are automatically installed on start up.

You can also use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/).
To use F-Droid, enable "Settings" -> "Security" -> "Allow installation of apps from unknown sources".

### Troubleshooting

* `docker logs aind`
* `docker exec -it aind systemctl status anbox-container-manager`
* `docker exec -it aind ps -ef`
* `docker exec -it aind cat /var/lib/anbox/logs/console.log`

## FAQ
### Isn't encrypting the phone with strong passcode enough for anti-theft? Why do we need aind?
People in th real world are likely to set weak passcode like "1234" (or finger pattern), because they want to open email/phone/twitter/maps/payment apps in just a few seconds.

aind is expected to be used in conjunction with encryption, and to be used only for sensitive apps, with more strong passcode.

## TODOs
* Map different UID range per containers
* Support remote connection from phones and tablets, ideally using Web browsers (noVNC?).
* Better touch screen experience
* Redirect camera, notifications, ...
