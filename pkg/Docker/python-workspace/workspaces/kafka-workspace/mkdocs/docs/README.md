**This is a starting point to create docs for this workspace!**

> Don't neglect documentation for your workspace! Soon you will forget what you were doing with it. 
> This page exists for you to modify it, and write down everything you need to know next time you come here.

In order to change this page, simply modify the file `/home/docs/docs/README.md`. Changes will be applied automatically - the 
server that serves this page has live reload.

In order to add a new doc file, it is enough to create a file in the folder `/home/docs/docs` and add respective entry 
to the configuratiion file `/home/docs/mkdcs.yaml`.   

Open workspace terminal, and create new documentation file with some text at your will, and save changes

> `nano /home/docs/docs/new.md` 

edit file `mkdcs.yaml`  

> `nano /home/docs/mkdcs.yaml`  

Add record about the new file to **nav**, and save changes

```yaml
nav:
  - Home: pages/home/home.md
  - About: README.md
  - Get started: get-started.md
  - New: new.md
```
