= Environment setup

There are two main ways to get started with Seqera's Nextflow training course.

The first is to install the requirements locally (<<Local installation>>), which is best if you are already familiar with Git and Docker, or working offline.

The second is to use <<Gitpod>>, which is best for first-timers as this platform contains all the programs and data required.
Simply click the link and log in using your GitHub account to start the tutorial.

== Local installation

Nextflow can be used on any POSIX-compatible system (Linux, macOS, Windows Subsystem for Linux, etc.).

*Requirements*:

* Bash
* https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java 11 (or later, up to 18)]
* Git
* https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker]

*Optional requirements for this tutorial*:

* https://github.com/sylabs/singularity[Singularity] 2.5.x (or later)
* https://conda.io/[Conda] 4.5 (or later)
* http://www.graphviz.org/[Graphviz]
* https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS CLI]
* A configured AWS Batch computing environment

=== Download Nextflow:

Enter this command in your terminal:

[cmd]
----
wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash
----

Or, if you prefer curl:

[cmd]
----
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
----

Then ensure that the downloaded binary is executable:

[cmd]
----
chmod +x nextflow
----

AND put the nextflow executable into your $PATH (e.g. ~/usr/local/bin or ~/bin/)

=== Docker

Ensure you have Docker Desktop running on your machine. Download Docker https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[here].

=== Training material

You can view the training material here: https://training.seqera.io/

To download the material use `git clone https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-training-public.git`.

Then `cd` into the `nf-training` directory.

=== Checking your installation

Check the correct installation of `nextflow` by running the following command:

[cmd]
----
nextflow info
----

This should show the current version, system and runtime.

== Gitpod

A preconfigured Nextflow development environment is available using Gitpod.

*Requirements*:

 * A GitHub account
 * Web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox)
 * Internet connection

=== Gitpod quick start

To run Gitpod:

- Click the following URL:

https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-training-public

(which is our GitHub repository URL, prefixed with https://gitpod.io/#).

- Log in to your GitHub account (and allow authorization).

Once you have signed in, Gitpod should load (skip prebuild if asked).

=== Explore your Gitpod IDE

You should now see something similar to the following:

image::gitpod.welcome.png[]

**The sidebar** allows you to customize your Gitpod environment and perform basic tasks (copy, paste, open files, search, git, etc.). Click the Explorer button to see which files are in this repository.

**The terminal** allows you to run all the programs in the repository. For example, both `nextflow` and `docker` are installed and can be executed.

**The main window** allows you to view and edit files. Clicking on a file in the explorer will open it within the main window. You should also see the nf-training material browser (https://training.seqera.io/).

To test that the environment is working correctly, type the following into the terminal:

	nextflow info

This should come up with the Nextflow version and runtime information:

[cmd,linenums]
----
  Version: 22.04.2 build 5701
  Created: 16-05-2022 17:52 UTC
  System: Linux 5.16.20-051620-generic
  Runtime: Groovy 3.0.10 on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 11.0.13+8-LTS
  Encoding: UTF-8 (UTF-8)
----

=== Gitpod resources

- Gitpod gives you 50 hours of free environment runtime per month.
- It includes up to 16 CPUs and 30GB of workspace.
- Gitpod will time out after 30 minutes. However, changes are saved for up to 2 weeks (see the next section for reopening a timed out session).

See https://www.gitpod.io[gitpod.io] for more details.

=== Reopening a Gitpod session

You can reopen an environment from https://gitpod.io/workspaces. Find your previous environment in the list, then select the ellipsis (three dots icon) and select Open.

If you have saved the URL for your previous Gitpod environment, you can simply open it your browser to open the previous environment.

Alternatively, you can start a new workspace by following the Gitpod URL:
https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-training-public

If you have lost your environment, you can find the main scripts used in this tutorial in the `nf-training` directory to resume with a new environment. 

=== Saving files from Gitpod to your local machine.

To save any file from the explorer panel, right-click the file and select `Download`.

=== Training material

The training course can be accessed in your browser from https://training.seqera.io/.

== Selecting a Nextflow version

By default, Nextflow will pull the latest stable version into your environment.

However, Nextflow is constantly evolving as we make improvements and fix bugs.

The latest releases can be viewed on GitHub https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow[here].

If you want to use a specific version of Nextflow, you can set the NXF_VER variable as shown below:

[cmd]
----
export NXF_VER=22.04.5
----

WARNING: Most of this tutorial workshop requires NXF_VER=22.04.0 or later, to use DSL2 as default.

Run `nextflow -version` again to confirm that the change has taken effect.
