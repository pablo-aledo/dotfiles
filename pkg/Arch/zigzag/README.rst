Zigzag
======

This package contains the implementation of **zigzag**, an algorithm for the
`Smallest grammar problem <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest_grammar_problem>`_

The zigzag algorithm and the Minimal Grammar Parsing are described (among other
things) in the following publications:

- `Choosing Word Occurrences for the Smallest Grammar Problem`. Rafael Carrascosa, François Coste, Matthias Gallé, Gabriel G. Infante López. LATA 2010.
- `The Smallest Grammar Problem as Constituents Choice and Minimal Grammar Parsing`. Rafael Carrascosa, François Coste, Matthias Gallé, Gabriel G. Infante López. Algorithms vol 4.
- `Searching for smallest grammars on large sequences and application to DNA`.  Rafael Carrascosa, François Coste, Matthias Gallé, Gabriel G. Infante López. J. Discrete Algorithms vol 11.


A small disclaimer: 
I used this code to get my degree (was written fast) and I
didn't knew much python at the time... so it might be a
little messy.
