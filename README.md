> Something mysterious is formed, born in the silent void. Waiting alone and unmoving, it is at once still and yet in constant motion. It is the source of all programs. I do not know its name, so I will call it the Tao of Programming.
> 
>   If the Tao is great, then the operating system is great. 
>   If the operating system is great, then the compiler is great. 
>   If the compiler is great, then the application is great. 
>   The user is pleased, and there is harmony in the world.
> 
> The Tao of Programming flows far away and returns on the wind of morning.
