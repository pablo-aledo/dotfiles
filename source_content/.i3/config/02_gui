# The font above is very space-efficient, that is, it looks good, sharp and
# clear in small sizes. However, if you need a lot of unicode glyphs or
# right-to-left text rendering, you should instead use pango for rendering and
# chose a FreeType font, such as:
# font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 10
# floating_minimum_size 75 x 50
# floating_maximum_size -1 x -1
